# Members Only
Cal Band has a website for logistics, lovingly named, "Members Only." It handles attendance, bus ride logistics, uniform parts, and many other functions. Band members can log in to view their information, and specific leadership positions have access to certain pages, such as assigning "points" to members or sending a notification to members.

The "Computer Committee" maintains and updates the website. As a member, I had to work with a large code base that utilized Django, SASS, and jQuery. Every pull request made had a code review that checked for unnecessary code, bad style, and ensured that it worked. From February to April, 5 of my pull requests were merged, with 779 lines of code added. A small example is an improvement in our notification interface. I added two buttons. Notifications can have links, so one button sends the user to the link, and the text in the button changes according to the page that is linked. The other marks the notification as read, so that users can filter through their unread notifications instead of viewing all at the same time.

# Why not add angry reacts, too?
The largest feature I added was a suggestion box. Previously, the Cal Band suggestion box was a Google Form. Moving the suggestion box to Members Only allows members to still submit suggestions anonymously, but can optionally provide contact info from their Django User model. This also notifies the leadership whenever a suggestion is submitted. Thus, my task was to create two pages: one for members to submit a suggestion, and another for the leadership to view the suggestions.

This leadership page turned out to be a more difficult task than I originally anticipated. After making a simple page that directly listed all suggestions, our Computer Coordinator gave me new tasks:
- Be able to mark/filter suggestions as read/unread  
- Be able to mark suggestions as resolved/unresolved  
- Allow the leadership to add comments that the other leaders can view  
- If not anonymous, allow the leadership to send a notification to the suggestor  

And thus, I created Facebook, but for Cal Band leadership... I suggested that we could also add "reacts" to the suggestions, but that was quickly swatted down.

I ended up having to write my own SASS and jQuery files to make the interface better for the leadership. Similar to the notifications page, I allowed the leadership to be able to filter out read/unread suggestions. I also created two different lists, each for resolved or unresolved suggestions. The comments were much more difficult to implement. In the end, I made a row with a table inside. The table was then filled with comments. The toughest part, however, was figuring out how to use the Django Form functionality for this case. 

Since there were multiple different suggestions, there were multiple "Add Comment" buttons. How could I ensure that each button were linked with the suggestion it is under? Also, for each suggestion, there were two buttons, one for "Add Comment," and another for "Send Notification to Sender." How do I know which button was selected? For these two issues, I added an HTML field for `name` and `value`:
{% raw %}
`<button type="submit" class="add-comment" name="add_comment" value="{{ suggestion.pk }}">Add Comment</button>`
{% endraw %}
In my Django View code, I added:
```
def form_valid(self, form):
    comment = form.save(commit=False)
    comment.rosterentry = self.request.user.rosterentry

    # Check if submit button clicked was notify_sender or add_comment
    if 'notify_sender' in form.data:
        pk = form.data['notify_sender']
        comment.suggestion = SuggestionBoxEntry.objects.get(pk=pk)
        notification = NotificationItem.objects.create_and_email(
            receiver=comment.suggestion.sender,
            subject=f'Response to Suggestion: {comment.suggestion.subject}',
            message=comment.comment,
            sender_roster = comment.rosterentry,
        )
        comment.comment = f'[SENT NOTIFICATION TO SENDER]: {comment.comment}'
    elif 'add_comment' in form.data:
        pk = form.data['add_comment']
        comment.suggestion = SuggestionBoxEntry.objects.get(pk=pk)
    ...
```
I was very excited when this worked! In the future, I'm hoping to improve the interface even futher. When adding a comment, it forces the browser to refresh in order to see the comment. I don't want this, and want to use AJAX so that the experience is not interrupted every time a comment is added.

# Final Thoughts
The Computer Committee turned out to be much more educational than I originally thought it would be. I felt that I learned both web dev and good software practices. This was the first time that I used SASS and jQuery, as well as the first time that I interacted with a large Django codebase. The committee makes sure that all pull requests go through a code review and a style check. I'm also grateful that I was able to learn alongside my fellow Cal Bandsmen! I hope to continue contributing to this group and improve the web services to Cal Band!
