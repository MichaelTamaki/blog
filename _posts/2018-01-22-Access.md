Inspired by the fact that a third of all food produced is either wasted or lost, my team at HackDavis designed a web app, "Access." This provides a platform for restaurants to publicly post their expiring food, so that the food does not go to waste and low income students and people can have food.

Thank you to my teammates that I met at the hackathon: Pulkit Agarwal and Harshit Agarwal from SJSU and Manuel Moya from Cabrillo College. Thank you to the organizers and volunteers of HackDavis for a fun event!

# Meeting New Friends From Different Backgrounds

When we first met and discussed our skillsets, I was surprised by my teammates' shared proficiency in PHP. As we begun development, I learned new technologies and ways to structure the code. They set up our project in [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) with a MySQL database. We also did this without any web frameworks at all, so we had to write our own SQL queries, our own login/registration system, etc. I had very little experience in any of these technologies.

Coming from my background, I was only familiar with Python for backend languages, as well as making sure to use a virtual machine and a web framework, such as Django. Thus, my first 16 hours of the hackathon was mostly frustration that I had little idea what was going on. My contibutions were limited to simple user interface features using Bootstrap 4.

However, 18 hours into the hackathon around 5:30am, I was finally able to make a meaningful full stack feature: searching a geographic region for food and displaying the results on the web page. Throughout the rest of the hackathon, I understood what was happening in my teammates' PHP code and could have technical discussions about our code. After a grueling start to the hackathon, this felt like a major personal accomplishment.

From this experience, I personally learned a lot about how to approach a project and technologies that I was barely familiar with. I also learned how to make contributions the best that I could without knowing much about a project. I am grateful to my teammates who were patient and guided me throughout the hackathon.
