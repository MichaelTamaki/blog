# "Marching Music's Major League"
Every summer since 2014, I've participated in [Drum Corps International](http://www.dci.org/), a national youth performing arts organization. I started with [Gold (Oceanside, CA)](http://www.goldyoutharts.org/drumcorps/) in 2014, 2015, then moved to the [Mandarins (Sacramento, CA)](http://www.mandarins.org/) in 2016. A basic explanation of drum corps is that it is a marching band half time show, but on steroids. The visual and musical demands are significantly higher, as precision, musicality, emotion, and power are emphasized. Below is a 2 minute clip from my show in 2016 (you'll see me with the tuba section!). One of my favorite segments while performing is the big brass impact at 1:20. The opener builds up to that climax, and the tension released in the moment brings out smiles in the crowd! Seeing the audience's reaction kinda makes you feel like a rockstar, in a *badass* sort of way.

For summer 2017, I'll be with the [Blue Knights (Denver, CO)](http://ascendperformingarts.org/programs/bkdbc/). I'm excited to be a part of such a high level group and to perform on their national tour! Just like the past summers, I'll be rehearsing 10-14 hours every day, and thus I have to leave my computer and personal projects for 3 months... But even though I'll miss my beloved laptop, the experience is worth it. Drum corps is an activity that I've grown to love, and something that I'll continue to be passionate about. The friends and experiences I've made have become a significant part of my life and makes me who I am as a person today, and I can't wait for my summer with the Blue Knights. I'm excited to grow as a performer and as a person in my fourth year of drum corps!
