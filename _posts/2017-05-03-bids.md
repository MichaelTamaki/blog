Beginning my second year of college, I entered an Undergraduate Research Apprentice position with the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS). I was given the opportunity to participate in the "machine shop," which was a group that handled the software engineering aspect of research. Through open source style projects, I experienced good software development and open source practices. The work included Python and React. In my two semesters with the organization, I learned how to contribute to open source projects on Github, set up development environments, handle a large code base, integrate libraries, and work in a team.

# Fall 2016: Music Analysis
My first group helped analyze features in music files. The features included "spectral centroid," "fluctuation entropy," and "pulse clarity."" This would then be used to analyze fMRI data of test subjects that listened to certain music files, which would correlate certain features to brain activity. I was stoked to participate in this group because of the fusion of my passions for music and computer science!

My main role was to evaluate the existing code base, create tests with coverage, and integrate Travis-CI for continuous integration. Initially, it was strange, as I had never had to dive into someone else's code before. I quickly learned that it was impossible to take in everything at once; I had to take it in parts, and accept that I wouldn't be able to understand everything starting out. Additionally I experienced what it was like to learn new libraries, such as numpy and librosa. Perhaps the most difficult challenge I met was implementing continuous integration. It was frustrating to see tests pass on my local machine, but fail on Travis-CI. This problem mainly boiled down to errors in our Python library installation process, such as making sure the Travis-CI library versions matched our local machines. Addressing these issues gave me insight on how to set up a develpoment environment and ensure that it is consistent across operating systems.

# Spring 2017: Time Series Analysis
Similar to the music analysis, this group focused on analyzing waves/time series. The main library we worked with was [Cesium](http://cesium-ml.org/), and my main role was to create a user interface tour using the React Joyride library.

The code base for the web app was much more complex than the prior semester. There were various web technologies such as React, Redux, Tornado, and peewee. The most challenging aspect was figuring out how the front-end interacted with the back-end. One job I had was to create a button that created an example dataset for the user to play with. Originally I thought this was a simple task, as I had created simple HTML buttons with javascript actions before. However, this turned out to be much more complex than I anticipated. I had to figure out React and Redux worked, as well as how it dispatches actions via Tornado. The prior semester's experience greatly helped as I had already experienced how to learn and integrate libraries, but it was difficult learning how they all worked together.

Here is an example of a [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) that I had to create: 
```
// Create example dataset
export function createExampleDataset(projectID) {
  var form_data = new FormData();
  form_data.append('projectID', projectID);
  form_data.append('create_example', true);

  return dispatch =>
    promiseAction(
      dispatch,
      CREATE_EXAMPLE_DATASET,

      fetch('/dataset', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: form_data,
      })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then((json) => {
            dispatch(fetchDatasets());
            dispatch(hideExpander('newDatasetExpander'));
            dispatch(resetForm('newDataset'));
          }).catch(ex => console.log('createExampleDataset', ex))
    );
}
```

At first glance, figuring out how to create an action was a daunting task. Fortunately, with the help of my mentor, Stefan, I was able to eventually implement the various libraries used to create this simple action.

# Final Thoughts
I am grateful that this opportunity gave me perspective on what working in the software engineering industry is like. Previously, with my classwork, I saw programming as just straightforward coding. With BIDS, I found that software engineering required lots of meetings, code reviews, working with a code base made by someone else, and using Google a lot more to figure out how to integrate the various libraries and technologies used. I now use the skills learned in this position to maintain good software engineering practices in my personal projects. I try to make sure that my personal projects are reproducible on other machines by making a clear development environment. I also learned about Continuous Integration, and I hope to implement Travis-CI in my personal projects. Overall, this was a great educational experience and I hope to continue learning about software engineering outside of my classes!
