                Education
              </h2>
              <p>
                I graduated with a degree in <span class="has-text-primary">Computer Science</span> and minor in <span class="has-text-primary">Music</span> from the <span class="has-text-primary">University of California, Berkeley</span> in May 2019. Go Bears! üêª
              </p>
              <p>
                My college life was largely defined by student-run organizations. To name a few, I got to march with the tubas in the <span class="has-text-primary">Cal Band</span> ü•Å, managed the student newspaper's website at <span class="has-text-primary">The Daily Californian</span> üì∞, and played covers of video game, anime, and film music with the <span class="has-text-primary">Intermission Orchestra</span> üéÆ.
              </p>
              <p>
                I gained most of my initial full-stack knowledge through taking on the computer manager leadership positions in <span class="has-text-primary">Cal Band</span> and <span class="has-text-primary">The Daily Californian</span>. I refactored and added new features to old codebases written in <span class="has-text-primary">Python/Django</span>, <span class="has-text-primary">PHP/Wordpress</span>, and <span class="has-text-primary">HTML/SCSS/JS</span>, as well as updating infrastructure that used <span class="has-text-primary">MySQL/PostgreSQL</span>, <span class="has-text-primary">Ubuntu</span>, and <span class="has-text-primary">Heroku/Linode</span>. It was a great learning experience that also taught me how to effectively teach and work with teammates.

              <p>
                The summer after my junior year, I took a position as a Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank">Okta</a> in <span class="has-text-primary">San Francisco</span>. I was placed with the <span class="has-text-primary">UI and Plugins team</span>, where I got to work on a project for the <span class="has-text-primary">browser plugin</span>. I got to explore my interests in <span class="has-text-primary">security</span> while learning more about <span class="has-text-primary">web development</span>. After the summer ended, I happily accepted a return offer as a Software Engineer!
              </p>
              <p>
                Since August 2019, I've been working at <span class="has-text-primary">Okta</span> with the same team. I've gotten to work on both the <span class="has-text-primary">browser plugin</span> and the <span class="has-text-primary">end-user dashboard</span> used for single sign-on. The development is mostly full-stack, working on features using <span class="has-text-primary">Java</span>, <span class="has-text-primary">backbone.js</span>, <span class="has-text-primary">React</span>, <span class="has-text-primary">Typescript</span> and <span class="has-text-primary">OpenID/Connect</span>.

                The <span class="has-text-primary">Cal Band</span> has a unique marching style, so it is difficult to design half time shows using traditional marching band charting software. <span class="has-text-primary">Calchart 4</span> is the fourth iteration of Cal Band's self-made software that is used to organize the 200+ marchers on the field. I am currently leading the development of this iteration, with a focus of creating a Progressive Web App rather than a native app.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a completely client-side application, and I am learning a lot about front-end development. We are using <span class="has-text-primary">Vue.js</span> with <span class="has-text-primary">Typescript</span>, with emphasis on testing using <span class="has-text-primary">Jest</span> and <span class="has-text-primary">Cypress</span>.

                My personal website has been a way for me to learn about <span class="has-text-primary">web design</span> and to focus on expanding my knowledge of <span class="has-text-primary">HTML/CSS</span>. I created a build pipeline using <span class="has-text-primary">Gulp</span> and used <span class="has-text-primary">Bulma</span> as the style framework.

                Other than taking fitness classes with OktaFIT, playing video games with friends, and exploring the Bay Area, I enjoy training for marathons. I've participated in the <span class="has-text-primary">SF and LA marathons</span> since 2018. It's been a fun way to stay active and be a part of the community.
