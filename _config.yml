# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a junior at UC Berkeley looking for a spring or summer internship in full stack web development.
  I love engineering together and deploying applications that make an impact. Through creating personal
  projects and collaborating with mentors, I've gained an understanding of backend development in Django
  and frontend development in Sass, jQuery, and Vue.js. Please check out my personal projects and website
  for more information, and I look forward to getting in contact with you!
